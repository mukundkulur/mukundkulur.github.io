Having an idea, I cofounded <strong>ThirdEye</strong> with my friends. The idea was to enable visually challenged students to be integrated into the increasingly digital classrooms. With a revolutionary concept involving smart materials, product and software development we enable digital content to be projected onto a tablet screen, in braille format. This opened the previously closed world to quick and easy access. 

My role was in the branding, product and strategic development. With our exceptional business model, our venture was awarded the 'Most Investor Ready' Startup Award for year 2015.
