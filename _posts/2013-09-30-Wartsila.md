Wärtsilä wanted to digitalise their Marine Field service operations and engaged me and my multi-disciplinary team to build future scenarios that covered the whole service lifecycle and forecast how the technologies would impact and influence the operations. With an objective to digitalise their services, our team researched, defined and developed service scenarios that would establish them as the technological leaders in marine field services.
