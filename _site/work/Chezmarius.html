<strong>Chez Marius</strong> is a small brick and mortar shop located in downtown Helsinki. As part of a UX research project, our goal was to study the business and evaluate its services in relation to the customer experience and user satisfaction. For this, we gathered insights on the web services and the retail storefront through observation, interviews and surveys.
