The objective was to develop a PackageROI tool. It is used to evaluate package concepts and increase collaboration across their value networks. As a strategic tool it enables the business owner to consider all the elements of a package to plan, communicate and execute the development activities. It is a practical application of design thinking, giving a holistic perspective that integrates consumer desirability, technology feasibility and business viability.
