<strong>Welcome to the future of travelling.</strong><br />
Finnair required us to conceptualise the future of the aircraft boarding experience. Through our research, journey mapping and systems mapping we conceptualised a robotic personal assistant. 
</p>
<p>
Your ultimate travel assistant, Finn-e, greets you at the gate taking over all the operations from check-in to leisure activities within the airport. It intimates you with updates on your flight schedule and transforms into a complete in-flight assistant during the flight. Finn-e covers all your needs from airport to airport, letting you relax as you move around the globe.
