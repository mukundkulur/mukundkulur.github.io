I did my internship at <strong>Icarus Nova</strong>. Icarus was a product development firm, rebranding themselves to compete in the medical device and development sector. 

My work was to audit their design and development process for their Entraview Lean project, with a core focus on project planning, collaboration and execution. Using design methods and benchmarking, I analysed the operations and provided them results that enable them to better understand their processes and activities. 

In addition I worked in researching the market to identify possible business development opportunities. A short strategy for market penetration and customer development was proposed.
