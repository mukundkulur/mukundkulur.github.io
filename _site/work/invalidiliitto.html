Collaborating with <strong>Invalidiliitto,</strong> The Finnish Association of People with Physical Disabilities, helped me gain insights on designing solutions for people with special needs. In this case it was to improve such a user and his/her interaction with dogs that assist them.
</p>
<p>
The dogs assisted the user in a variety of tasks - helping pick up things, open doors, etc. Based on insights obtained through shadowing, interviews and observation concepts were developed. The final solution is a dog friendly pointing device that can be attached to the head / arm and help the user direct the dog to pick correct objects from a clutter.
